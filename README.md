# NAFLD-Identification-using-Image-Processing-and-Deep-Learning

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our project on **NAFLD Identification using Image Processing and Deep Learning**. In this project, we leveraged image processing techniques and deep learning neural networks to successfully identify Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) using ultrasound images as our dataset. We achieved a high level of accuracy in our predictions, showcasing the potential of machine learning in medical image analysis.

## Project Highlights

- **Objective**: The primary goal of this project was to develop a robust and accurate system for identifying NAFLD from ultrasound images.
- **Tech Stack**: Our project was implemented using Python and utilized popular libraries such as Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks and image processing operations.
- **Methodology**: We employed deep learning neural networks to extract features from ultrasound images, enabling us to make accurate predictions about the presence of NAFLD.
- **Accuracy**: The achieved accuracy of our model demonstrates its effectiveness in distinguishing between healthy and NAFLD-affected liver images.

## Project Structure

Our project repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the ultrasound image dataset used for training and testing.
- `code/`: Here, you'll find the Python scripts and notebooks that were used for image preprocessing, model development, training, and evaluation.
- `results/`: This directory holds the outcome of our project, including model performance metrics, visualizations, and any additional analysis.
